We are always looking for people interested in presenting talks of 5, 15 or 30
minutes at the upcoming events. Whether you are a developer, system
administrator, architect, scrum master or other, we want to hear from you!

Share your knowledge, discoveries, stories of great success and worthy failures
on topics around the DevOps universe. You can present in English or French and
no need to be a world leader in the subject.

Submit your idea by
[writing to us](mailto:devops-montreal-admin@googlegroups.com).
