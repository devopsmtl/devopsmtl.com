DevOps Montréal explores the intersection of software development and systems
operations, in an era of agile development, cloud computing and automation. We hold
monthly meetings around the DevOps movement, more particularly on products,
technologies and methodologies since 2011.

These meetings are generally composed of presentations, demos and discussions.
We invite everyone interested in the subject to join us, whether you are a
neophyte or an expert.
