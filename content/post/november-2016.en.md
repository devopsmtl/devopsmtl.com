## Presentations

### James: Next Generation Config Mgmt: Part two
A presentation about a next gen config management tool, and the
specific problems this project solves.

Three of the main design features of the tool include:

* Parallel execution
* Event driven mechanism
* Distributed architecture

This talk will demo a prototype I've built that implement these ideas
and which is written in golang.
I will start by presenting an introduction to the tool.
I will then demo the new features that were added since the project
was introduced. This will include the automatic grouping, automatic
elastic etcd clustering and remote execution features.
I will finally share some of the future planned designs for the tool.

An introductory blog post on the subject is available:
https://ttboj.wordpress.com/2016/01/18/next-generation-configuration-mgmt/.  
Attendees are encouraged to read it before the talk if they are
interested!
